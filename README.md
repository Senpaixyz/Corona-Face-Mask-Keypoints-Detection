## IIT-K Internship Project
#### This project was created with the vision of developing a “Real-Time Face Mask Detection System” for public use, to help the public health officials and small to large establishments all over the world to effectively combat the Coronavirus pandemic. We hope that the model developed here by us, being a small research AI/ML community, enable developers around the globe to be able to use and deploy the same to build systems that would be capable to withstand the demands of a real-time, real-world use case.
#### Deep Learning was used to train the model, MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks) for detection of face and ResNet-50 (Residual Networks, 50 layers deep) for image classification in PyTorch. A deep neural network model was implemented and custom image augmentation was used for facial keypoints detection. The working of the model is represendted by the diagrams in the "Workflow" folder. Also, please refer the "IIT-K Project Report" pdf, for the vivid explanation and a better understanding of the project.
#### The best saved model after the training, which was neither overfit nor underfit having the lowest validation loss, resulted in an accuracy of 97% on the validation dataset, and an accuracy of 98% on the test dataset. Also, the model turns out to be highly accuracte in real-time given that the webcam doesn't run at a low FPS rate.
